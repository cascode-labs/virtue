# VIRTUE

Cadence Virtuoso SKILL++ library

Features:

- A standard library of functions for common tasks
- A test framework modelled after [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/)
- A [TOML config file](https://toml.io) reader and writer
- A package import system that allows the library to define just a single
top-level import table symbol that allows each package to be imported locally.
